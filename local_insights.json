Don't cut it with a knife - it's considered disrespectful. Best momo places are tiny street stalls, not fancy restaurants. Look for places with long queues of locals - that's where the real momos are. Price: 150-300 NPR for a plate.",

Smile and be friendly - it's a cultural exchange, not a battle. In tourist areas (Thamel, Lakeside), prices are inflated 3-5x. In local markets, prices are more fixed. Best bargaining: handicrafts, souvenirs, taxi rides. Don't bargain for food in restaurants - it's considered rude.
